# STAMINA GUI

STAMINA/STORM provides a simple dialog-box-like GUI that allows for simple STAMINA usage. The `stamina-cplusplus` executable must be accessable via your `PATH` variable. It helps if `xstamina.py` is also available via `PATH`.

## Required dependencies

1. `pyqt5`
2. `submodule` (should be included with your Python installation)

## Screenshots

## Future work:

Add PyBind (https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) bindings rather than using the `subprocess` module.
